## Hello there!

I'm Mrak, a young software engineer just about to finish my engineering degree and looking for a job.

I'm open to working with anything, but my favourite programming languages are C# and TypeScript. <br>
I'm experienced with creating back-ends with ASP.NET and Entity Framework Core. <br>
For front-ends, I have the most experience with vanilla JavaScript and CSS, but I'm expanding my knowledge into React. <br>
I also love creating games for fun, formerly in Unity but nowadays in Godot.

My most notable project is [UStacker](https://github.com/MrakDun-desu/UStacker-old), a hyper-customizable stacker game
I would like to rewrite for Godot and make multiplayer one day.

### ✨ Fun Facts ✨

  and I'm the founder of the CZ/SK Tetris Community
- I used to be a Boy Scout up until the end of high school
